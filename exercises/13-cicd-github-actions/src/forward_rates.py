"""Forward rate curve derivation from spot rates.

The forward rate f(t₁, t₂) is the rate the market implies today for
borrowing/lending between future times t₁ and t₂. It falls out of a
no-arbitrage argument: earning s₂ for t₂ years must equal earning s₁ for
t₁ years and then rolling into f from t₁ to t₂.

    (1 + s₂)^t₂ = (1 + s₁)^t₁ · (1 + f)^(t₂ − t₁)

Solving for f:

    f = [(1 + s₂)^t₂ / (1 + s₁)^t₁]^(1/(t₂ − t₁)) − 1

Business uses: FRA pricing, swap valuation, gauging market expectations
of future rate moves. Rates here are in percent (e.g. 4.5) on the
boundary, decimal internally.
